Chaos Glitch Mod - v 2.9.6 by Apache Thunder.
Credits to KyleTheScientist, Zatherz, Abe Clancy, and PlaguedPixel for their help/code for improving/making certain features possible.


Features:

1. Chaos Modes. These modes is accessed via the "chaos" command. Sub commands for this mode are as follows:

2. Glitch Modes. These modes can apply the glitch chest shader to enemies, objects and can add additional "super" glitch enemies to rooms.


For information on available sub commands, simply type "chaos" and press enter in the ETGMod console for help on valid commands for the mod.

There is also a bonus mod integrated into this mod. "DungeonFlow". This is a slight reworking of the old Anywhare mod to work with AG&D. Note that most floors can't be loaded with this anymore. But this can be used to load Bossrush levels, the glitch chest floor and a NPCParadise test room. RocketMod does not currently have this feature. ;)

Command syntax is mostly the same as old anywhere mod. Use "load_flow help" in console to get help on how to use this command.

Also included is a separate ZIP file containing a version of the mod with chaos extreme mode enabled by default. It can still be disabled via chaos reset like normal. 

Compiling and versions of Enter the Gungeon required:

This source code uses C#. Visual Studio 2015 or newer recommended.
